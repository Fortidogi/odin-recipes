# odin-recipes
First overall THE ODIN PROJECT... project. So far; learned some basic 
compsci, basic CLI and terminal inputs for BASH, git usage, and html 
fundamentals. This project is for a basic recipe website. I'm doing this 
curriculum to learn scripting, so this is a bit out of my area of 
interest, but since its been fun so far, I might as well keep going, 
right?
