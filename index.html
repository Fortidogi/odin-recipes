    <p>I've been cooking quite a bit recently, actually. A long bout of unemployment has left me with a lot of free time on my hands. I live with my older sister, Michelle, who practically raised me-- growing up, some of the fondest memories I have come from sitting at the bar behind the kitchen in our Long Island home, impatiently swinging my feet back and forth, watching and waiting as she prepared something on a whim for us to enjoy. Usually it'd be an Eastern European pastry I'd never heard of, as per her interests. It was always good, usually beyond good. In my professionally unprofessional opinion, she's the best to have ever done it.</p>
    <p>That's why, as a way of breaking myself out of the ennui of repetitive job hunting, I took it upon myself to return the favor. Now, I've never been "responsible," "motivated," or "good at multitasking," as some might say you ought to be to tackle the role of chef... But, surprisingly enough, I took to it pretty well! A few missteps early on, sure, but everything I've cooked recently has gotten rave reviews. In the end, making something for someone and seeing them smile like mad over it? That's REAL good for your self esteem.</p>
    <p>Once we go our seperate ways (she's moving to Korea in a month or so,) I imagine I'll return to my usual subsistence lifestyle, the old bachelor fare of bread and cheese and whatever overpriced takeout I fancy at the moment. Cooking, for me, has been about doing something for the people I care about-- I just can't motivate myself for myself, you know? But maybe I'll find someone else to feed. If so, I'll have this set of recipes to bank on.

    <p>As a note, most of these are taken from online recipe sites, so I'll be sure to link to them at the end of each 'description' section. Without further ado, here's what I've liked making the most.</p>
