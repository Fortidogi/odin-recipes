    <h2>Delicious and low-effort</h2>
    <p>I was looking for something to satisfy our craving for shrimp-- I'd had some wild success with other seafood, as will be shown in the recipes after this, and I wanted to follow that up with something a little less stressful to make. Shrimp scampi was part of a rotating cabal of Italian premade dishes we got used to plucking from the freezer, and it didn't seem too challenging at all, although I really didn't know what the heck it WAS beyond 'pasta with shrimp in it.'</p>
    <p>As it happens (according to Wikipedia,) 'scampi' appears to refer to any dish involving crustaceans sauteed in olive oil, garlic, and white wine. The pasta is apparantly optional. For that matter, the recipe I ended up following doesn't use olive oil. What a fraud I am! (Well, suck it-- this was really good, and if it gets me executed by the shrimp police, so be it.) Instead, the oil component of the sauce is provided by a good chunk of butter, browned with careful timing as a flavorful base for the shrimp, garlic, and wine to mix together with, thus the name. It produces a thicker sauce, so I paired it with a thicker whole-wheat spaghetti to soak it all up. Worked like a charm. This unfortunately isn't reflected in the photo above, but I couldn't be bothered to find one with browner pasta.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1lb pasta</strong>, dry weight. Original recipe reccommends linguine; I used whole wheat spaghetti.</li>
      <li><strong>1/3 cup butter</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1lb shrimp prawns,</strong> preferrably fresh, though I used frozen.</li>
      <li><strong>4 cloves, or 1 tbsp, minced garlic</strong></li>
      <li><strong>1/4 cup dry white cooking wine,</strong> or substitute vermouth or chicken broth. I don't know what vermouth is.</li>
      <li><strong>2 tbsp lemon juice,</strong> fresh squeezed, or prepackaged in my case.</li>
      <li><strong>Salt</strong> to taste; I used sea salt for the pasta water, and table salt for the shrimp.</li>
      <li><strong>Pepper,</strong> to taste. The original recipe says 1 pinch each for s/p, but like, come on.</li>
      <li><strong>1/4 tsp red pepper chili flakes,</strong> plus extra to garnish.</li>
      <li><strong>1 tbsp fresh parsely,</strong> chopped, plus extra to garnish. Unsure if dried would work well.</li>
      <li><strong>1 tbsp fresh basil,</strong> chopped, plus extra to garnish. Didn't have this. :[</li>
      <li><strong>1/2 cup parmesan cheese,</strong> grated, plus extra to garnish.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Total prep: 10m; Total cook time: 10m: serves 5.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Boil salted water in a large pot; cook pasta according to package instructions (assumed 5-7m) until al-dente. Retain about 1/4 cup of the pasta water after draining for later. While pasta is cooking, we'll brown the butter.</li>
      <li>Melt the butter over low heat in mid-sized pan or skillet, pref light colored so you can track the browning process better. Stir/swirl occasionally and watch closely; you're waiting for the foam to subside, and for the color of the butter to change to a golden brown. (Remember to keep an eye on the pasta too.)</li>
      <li>Once it does, quickly stir in the shrimp and add the garlic-- this will stop the browning process. Timing is important here. You don't want the butter to burn or evaporate! (In my case, pasta finished around here.) Continue cooking for 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>After about 2 minutes, add the wine and lemon juice, and saute for another minute.</li>
      <li>Season to taste with salt, pepper, red chili flakes. Shrimp should be just barely gaining color now. Continue cooking for 2 more minutes, or until done. (Shrimp should be pink, firm, U-shaped, matte, and have a firm outline with no translucency.)</li>
      <li>Stir the parmesan cheese into the pasta, combining it with the remaining pasta water; stir the herbs and some more red pepper chili flakes into the shrimp; then combine everything and stir it all up. Garnish with remaining herbs and red pepper chili flakes.</li>
    </ol>
